# This is a fork of splunk/docker-splunk/enterprise.

* The Dockerfile has been changed to create the splunk user as a normal user instead of a system user.
* With splunk being the first user to be created it gets a UID of 1000. 
* This makes permision management when sharing a mount easier.
* Intended for rapid development of splunk apps in a docker container.
